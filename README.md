# Codebarker

An application that allows the user to learn about code smells through community submissions.

* As a user I can view a smell and vote on what smell it is
* As a user I can submit source code from an open source github application as a smell
* As a user I can vote whether I agree or disagree on a potential code smell submission
* As a user I can see an overview of my submissions
