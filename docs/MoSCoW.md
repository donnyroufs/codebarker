## Must Have

1. Interactive page to learn code smells (coming from pre-made cases)

## Should Have

1. Github Project Finder

2. Code analyzer for cases (tools like: mark sections, files, add notes, add code smells and relations)

3. Notifications (approved code smell case)

## Could Have

1. Analytics personal progress (smells you have done so far, current rank, approved/denied cases)

## Won't have

1. Request code analyzes (paid)

   1. A company could just analyze their own repo and have it be there, what do I need to add to make sure paying for it is worth it?

2. Graph of your activity (github like?)

3. External tools to inform authors of cases (vscode extensions for example)

4. Collaboration (teams, learn together)

5. Code Solutions (you only have notes)

6. Pull Requests for analyzed code base author

7. User Profile (public)

8. Macro level cases (architecture)
